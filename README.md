This is a website I built for a friend of mine that has a yoga business in California.

I used HTML, Sass and a tiny bit of Stimulus.js for this project.

The design was created in Figma and then approved by the client before I began coding.

I also learned how to creat a working form through formspree and add the necessary JS to include her Calendly.
